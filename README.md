Website for everything...me.

This is an ongoing programming project for me to integrate with my YouTube channel.

The website was revamped in August 2016, though I'm still not quite happy with it.  I may make a couple more changes.

In the future, I may also add a ComputerCraft page that contains all of the ComputerCraft programs that I have made and published over the course of my short existence on the internets. Preferrably, this page will be ComputerCraft-themed, and different from the rest of the website. Though this will only happen if I'm actually interested in taking the time. Most of the time, I'm focused on my own projects and don't take the time to update this website. The back-end Javascript could use an update. It's probably pretty inefficient.

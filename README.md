Website for everything...me.

This is an ongoing programming project for me to integrate with my YouTube channel. I would like to revamp the website to make it look much neater in the future. Currently, time will not allow.

In the future, I will also add a ComputerCraft page that contains all of the ComputerCraft programs that I have made and published over the course of my short existence on the internets. Preferrably, this page will be ComputerCraft-themed, and different from the rest of the website.

                This is the ultimate pranking program. This Java 7 program is practically a means of communicating between two computers through a secure AES-128 connection. This is my most sophisticated program that I've written yet.
                <br>1. Copy the SERVER.jar to the victim's computer.
                <br>2. Open GetIPv4.bat. Write down the IPv4 address that corresponds to Local Area Connection. You will need this later.
                <br>3. Run SERVER.jar.
                <br>4. Go back to your own computer and run CLIENT.bar. This will open a Java command prompt window.
                <br>5. Type in the IP that you wrote down, and you are now connected to your friend's or sibling's computer through the same network.
                <br>7. Type /help to see commands. Anything else that you type will appear on their screen.
                <br>NOTE: THE VICTIM AND MASTER COMPUTERS MUST BE ON THE SAME NETWORK. ALSO, THE ROUTER NEEDS TO FORWARD PORT 444 TO THE VICTIM'S IP ADDRESS.

                This was a major learning experience that shoed me the confines of the Windows Batch language. (bash is better)
                <br>This is a game that I started working on a few years ago. I was obsessed with the popular game Minecraft at the time. Basically, the scope of the project was to build a command line game that was like Minecraft in an aerial 2D sense. After extensive work, I created a game that had a nice GUI for being inside of Windows Command Prompt, had relatively easy controls, and still a few bugs. Now, due to my lack of enjoyment in coding in Batch, the game's bugs remain.
                <br>Change the file extension from <b>.file</b> to <b>.bat</b> to run.
                <br><b>Known bugs:</b>
                <br>- Blocks can only be placed on the left side of the screen.
                <br>- A world save is lost after the game is closed.
                <br>- World save files are not written and read properly to construct a proper environment.

                I created this program for fun. It is to be used as a two player game. I never implemented a player versus computer version as I was not capable of such a feat in Batch programming. All I could think of doing was building a function that would win every single time, using the not-so-secret sequence to Tic-Tac-Toe.
